# Wiki.janet
This is a helper script/program to manage personal wiki-style knowledgebases.  
It is kind of a commandline equivalent of Obsidian or can also be seen as a wrapper for for example vimwiki and uses git for syncing of different machines as well as versioning of the documents.  

At the moment the program incorporates code from other projects that I want to attribute below:
- [Spork](https://github.com/janet-lang/spork)
- [Bearimy](https://git.sr.ht/~pepe/bearimy) and [Marble](https://git.sr.ht/~pepe/marble)
- [jff](https://git.sr.ht/~pepe/jff.git)
- [janet-filesystem](https://github.com/jeannekamikaze/janet-filesystem)
- [remarkable](https://github.com/pyrmont/remarkable)
- [libcyaml](https://github.com/tlsa/libcyaml/)
- [janet-uri](https://github.com/andrewchambers/janet-uri)
